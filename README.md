# Art

Various pieces of graphic design art made for fun. Use the Makefile to convert
all the art into png's stored in the `png` folder.

Note some SVG's may not render properly on GitHub or browsers because certain
features of SVG's, such as gradient meshes, are not fully supported yet. To view
the accurate versions, see the png folder.
